# GitHub Flavored Markdown README Style Guide #

## Overview ##
This is a style guide for GitHub Flavored Markdown READMEs. It will include syntax, cleanliness, content, and layout. Please feel free to improve upon this.

## Details ##
I have recently realized that there is no uniform style guide for GFM READMEs and I decided to ask about it on StackOverflow. They said, "Well, how about you make it, and we'll help." So here I am making it.

Let's start with content and layout.

I have used the same layout I am going to suggest in this same README. So let's see what we've got...

Start with a title, at a header level of 1

# Title #
```# Title #```
Notice the space inside the ```#```s. Much more readable than ```#Title#```

## Overview ##
Next should come an overview of your application. It should be short and not in great detail, simply stating what it's trying to do, and a basic idea of how it's doing ti. This should be at header level 2.
```## Overview ##```
