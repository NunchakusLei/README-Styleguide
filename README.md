# GitHub Flavored Markdown README Style Guide #

## Overview ##
This is a style guide for GitHub Flavored Markdown READMEs. It will include syntax, cleanliness, content, and layout. Please feel free to improve upon this.

## Details ##
I have recently realized that there is no uniform style guide for GFM READMEs and I decided to ask about it on StackOverflow. They said, "Well, how about you make it, and we'll help." So here I am making it.
